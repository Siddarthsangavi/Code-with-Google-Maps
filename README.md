# AR Navigation Assistant in Flutter

**Team Name:** Binary Brains
**Problem Statement:** AR Navigation Assistant in Flutter
**Team Leader Email:** siddarthsangavi28@gmail.com

## Brief about the Prototype

The AR Navigation Assistant in Flutter is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to seamlessly integrate Google Maps functionality with augmented reality (AR) features. Users can interact with maps, access real-time location data, and experience a unique AR navigation environment. The app displays the user's current location as a marker on the map, offers route navigation with polylines, and includes two action buttons for map-centered interaction. Augmented reality is employed to overlay Google Maps and navigation directions onto the real-world surroundings viewed through the device's camera. This offers an immersive navigation experience with real-time information and points of interest. The prototype has tremendous potential in various fields, including autonomous vehicles, tourism, urban planning, traffic management, delivery and logistics, and environmental conservation.

## Tech Stack

To build the "AR Navigation Assistant in Flutter" project, the following technologies and tools were used:

1. **Flutter**: As the primary framework for cross-platform app development.
2. **ARCore (Android) and ARKit (iOS)**: Integrated through Flutter plugins to enable augmented reality features.
3. **Location Services**: Utilized the `location` package for GPS-based location tracking.
4. **Camera Access**: Integrated Flutter packages (e.g., `camera`) for camera access in AR.
5. **Maps Integration**: Utilized the `google_maps_flutter` package for map integration.
6. **Gesture Recognition**: Employed Flutter's gesture detection capabilities.
7. **Multi-Language Support**: Integrated Flutter's internationalization (i18n) packages.
8. **Navigation and Routing**: Utilized routing services and libraries.
9. **Real-Time Data**: Integrated real-time traffic and safety data sources.
10. **Offline Mode**: Developed the capability for offline map and data usage.
11. **User-Generated Content**: Created a backend system to manage user-generated content.
12. **Monetization Tools**: Integrated in-app advertising (e.g., AdMob), subscription management, and analytics tools.
